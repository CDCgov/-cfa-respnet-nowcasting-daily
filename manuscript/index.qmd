  Nowcasting is an area of research dedicated to addressing reporting delays in the real-time monitoring of key epidemiological indicators like hospital admission counts. When data used for nowcasting is recorded on different timescales, like days versus weeks, it becomes a greater challenge to accurately account for delays. This paper specifically investigates the scenario where hospital admission data are reported weekly on a fixed day, resulting in daily admission times but weekly reporting times. We compare several methods for generating a daily nowcast from this weekly reporting cycle data, within the comprehensive framework of the `R` package `epinowcast`.

## Introduction

Infectious disease outbreaks pose significant challenges to public health authorities, necessitating accurate and timely estimation of metrics like counts of hospital admissions. Hospital admissions provide insights into the strain placed on the healthcare system by a specific pathogen. These insights facilitate the management of resources like hospital beds, supplies and equipment, and medical staff, allowing hospitals to respond more quickly to changes in volume of patients. This is especially important for large-scale respiratory viruses such as influenza (flu), COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): three viruses that, together, account for a large proportion of respiratory illness hospitalizations.

Record-keeping itself, however, is an additional burden on already overstretched hospitals. Hospital admissions are not typically reported on the day they occur; instead, there is a delay of days or weeks before the data is officially reported. This lag needs to be accounted for when ascertaining the number of hospital admissions occurring in real time. Nowcasting is the real-time estimation of metrics like hospital admissions, with adjustment for reporting delays. The granularity of these nowcasts plays a pivotal role; finer resolutions - for example, daily nowcasts as opposed to weekly - offer a more detailed understanding of the outbreak's dynamics. 

A significant challenge in nowcasting lies in navigating the complexities of reporting cycles. Much of the nowcasting literature tends to assume that event and report processes occur with the same temporal resolution; for example, daily event dates with daily report dates. It is a common problem, however, to have report times with lower resolution than event times. The case we focus on in this paper is the case of a fixed weekly reporting schedule, in which event data is given with daily resolution, but are reported once per week on a fixed day.

TODO: citations etc

Within the framework of the `R` package `epinowcast`, we evaluate a few possible methods for nowcasting hospital admissions daily with a weekly reporting cycle. We compare the nowcasts using these methods to each other and to the current baseline method which aggregates daily admission data to weekly to produce a weekly nowcast.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

### Nowcasting

Nowcasting is a class of methods that estimates the true current state of a time series when observations from that time series are subject to delays. Hospital admissions are a fairly simple case of this because they are subject only to administrative reporting delays, rather than latent period and other delays that infectious disease case counts are subject to. When admissions and reports are both on the same timescale (e.g., daily) reported data can be easily visualized as a "triangle": looking backward in time from the current, with each subsequent day back we gain one day of reported data.

[this is technically a fifth figure because I have four figures below, but it's meant to be a comparison to the one below... will work it out later.]

Nowcasting attempts to estimate the area in red, which is unknown due to reporting delays, by estimating a discrete probability distribution of delay times. This gives us a more accurate idea of hospitalizations in current time than the lagged data alone.

### The Fixed Weekly Reporting Cycle

The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or [RESP-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html) is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) system that tracks hospital admissions for three viruses that make up a significant proportion of hospitalizations caused by respiratory illnesses: respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), COVID-19, and influenza. These surveillance data are collected from counties in 12-14 states, accounting for about 8-10% of the U.S. propulation.

These data are collected with daily resolution; i.e., admission dates are collected at the daily level. The dates on which admission dates are recorded into a database, however, are not recorded with each admission date. Weekly, on a fixed day, a file containing all currently recorded admission dates is collected. Then, all information about the report date for each admission is associated with the day that the file containing all recorded admission dates is collected. Since this occurs once per week, report dates are only available with weekly resolution. TODO: other examples?

[Here: figure that illustrates the issue, reporting triangle?]

![](images/repcycle_reporting_tri_attempt1.png)

Current practice with these data is to aggregate the admission dates to weekly resolution to match the resolution of the report dates, and a weekly nowcast is obtained. The primary goal of this project is to compare several different methods of nowcasting with the original data to determine whether it is feasible to perform a daily nowcast rather than a weekly one.


### Modeling {#sec-modeling}

The `epinowcast` package in `R` is designed as a versatile framework for monitoring infectious diseases in real-time. It is an extension of the model developed by Günther et al. in _Nowcasting the COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria._ [@guntheretal], which itself was an extension of the model proposed by Höhle and Heiden [@hohleandheiden] that uses a Bayesian hierarchical model with a discrete time survival model for the reporting delay distribution.

Using `epinowcast`, we will compare four different methods for nowcasting a fixed weekly reporting cycle with daily resolution:

1. A model with a fixed day-of-week (DOW) reporting effect.

2. A model with a fixed effect hardcoded such that the reporting hazard for non-report days is approximately zero.

3.  A model which aggregates reporting probabilities and places them on only reporting days.

All three `epinowcast` models we will compare share very similar frameworks. The instantaneous growth rate $r_t$, defined as the log of the expected number of final observed hospital admissions between times $t$ and $t-1$, is modeled with a daily random walk:

$$\log r_1 \sim N(r_0, \sigma_1^2); \hspace{1em} \log r_t\mid r_{t-1} \sim N(\log r_{t-1}, \sigma^2)$$

And the expected final number of admissions for a admission day $t$, $\lambda_t = E[N_t]$, is given by

$$\lambda_1\sim\text{LogNormal}(\mu_\ell, \sigma_\ell); \hspace{1em} \lambda_t = r_t\lambda_{t-1}; \hspace{1em} t = 1,\dots T$$

where $T$ is the latest admission date. The delay distribution is parameterized with a discrete-time hazard model. Delay probabilities, given by $p_{t,d}$, are converted to hazards:

\begin{align}
  h_{t,d} &= P(\text{delay} = d \mid \text{delay} \geq d, W_{t,d}) \\
    &= p_{t,d}\bigg(1-\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} p_{t,i}\bigg)^{-1} \hspace{1em} t = 1,\dots T, d = 0,\dots D
\end{align}

where $D$ is the maximum possible delay, and $W_{t,d}$ is the design matrix that encodes the baseline delay distribution and the admission and report date covariate effects on the hazard. This can then be modeled via a logistic regression in a discrete-time hazard model

$$\text{logit}(h_{t,d}) = \gamma_{t,d} + \delta_0 + \beta_{f,\delta}X_\delta; \hspace{1em} t = 1,\dots T, d = 0,\dots D$$

where $\gamma_{t,d}$ represents the baseline hazard, for which we use a gamma distribution. The gamma distribution is discretized and adjusted for the maximum possible delay, $D$, to obtain parametric report probabilities $p'_{t,d}$. These are then converted to logit hazards as $\gamma_{t,d} = p_{t,d}\big(1-\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} p_{t,i}\big)^{-1}$.

A negative binomial likelihood is used to model notifications for each reference date $t$ and delay $d$,

$$n_{t,d}\mid \lambda_t, p_{t,d} \sim \text{NegBin}(\lambda_t p_{t,d}, \phi); \hspace{1em} t = 1,\dots T, d = 0,\dots D$$

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\phi}} \sim \text{Half-Normal}(0,1)$$

and finally we have 

$$N_t = \sum_{d=0}^D n_{t,d}$$

TODO: need to add expectation DOW random effect

#### DOW Fixed Effect Model {#sec-model1}

One simple way to handle the weekly reporting cycle is to place a reporting day-of-week fixed effect on the logit hazard. In the base model from @sec-modeling we can specify $\beta_{f,\delta} X_\delta$ as

$$\beta_1\mathbb{1}\{t+d = 
\text{Monday}\} + \beta_2\mathbb{1}\{t+d = 
\text{Tuesday}\} + \dots + \beta_7\mathbb{1}\{t+d = 
\text{Sunday}\}$$

The model will infer which day is the weekly reporting day from the data, and the coefficients of all the other day-of-week fixed effects will be inferred to be negative values large enough to make the hazard $h_{t,d}$ approximately zero, since there is no reporting probability for non-reporting days.


#### Hardcoded Fixed Effect Model {#sec-model2}

To improve efficiency and convergence of the model, we can modify the above in @sec-model1 so that `epinowcast` need not infer the reporting day, since it is already known. The same reporting effect on the hazard $\beta_{f, \delta} X_\delta$ from @sec-modeling can be hardcoded as

$$\beta_1 \mathbb{1}\{t+d \neq \text{Report Day}\}; \hspace{1em} \beta_1 = -20$$

This way, report dates which are not the weekly reporting day are explicitly modeled as having approximately zero reporting hazard.

#### Aggregated Reporting Probability Model {#sec-model3}

Instead of modifying the hazard, we can directly aggregate reporting probabilities to only reporting days. After daily reporting hazards $h_{t,d}$ are converted to daily reporting probabilities $p_{t,d}$, they can be summed

TODO: probability agg method in math

This process mimics more closely the reporting process that is occurring in reality, in which hospital admissions are entered into a database throughout the week and all admissions that have been entered before the reporting day are reported on the reporting day.

### Simulated Scenario

One outbreak scenario was simulated from a stochastic SEIHRD model (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Hospitalized - Recovered - Dead). Hospital admission reporting delays were simulated from a gamma distribution and with a weekend effect. Parameters which governed the simulation process are given in the table below.

|Parameter | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
|$N$ | Population size | $5\times 10^4$ |
|$\beta$ | Transmission rate per contact | $3/5$ |
|$1/\gamma$ | Mean latent period duration (days) | $3$ |
|$1/\nu$ | Mean infectious period duration (days) | $5$ |
|$1/\eta$ | Mean hospital stay duration (days) | $6$ |
|$1/\kappa$ | Mean duration of immunity (days) | $30$ |
|$\tau$ | Infection-Hospitalization ratio | $1/10$ |
|$v$ | Hospitalization-fatality ratio | $1/10$ |
|$k$ | Gamma reporting delay shape parameter | $3/2$ |
|$\theta$ | Gamma reporting delay scale parameter | $3$ |

These synthetic data are available entirely with daily resolution, including reporting dates (Daily/Daily data), which is not possible with the real data. They can be aggregated to daily admission data with weekly reporting data (Daily/Weekly), and to weekly admission data with weekly reporting data (Weekly/Weekly).

### RESP-NET Flu Data

The real data is Daily/Weekly influenza hospital admission data from RESP-NET. We use data from the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 flu seasons, and run nowcasts across a series of reporting dates from those seasons to compare Weekly/Weekly models (the baseline) with Daily/Weekly models.

TODO: add info about reweighting due to "delay_0"/"delay_1" effects. This may need to be discussed earlier especially if I redo the sim data to contain these.

## Results

TODO: Deeper outline of results section

### Evaluation

We compare performance of nowcasts using proper scoring rules [@czadoetal], which will evaluate both the calibration (accuracy) and the sharpness (precision) of the nowcasts. In particular, we use the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which is a score that generalizes absolute error. The CRPS is defined:

TODO: add description/math

### Simulated Scenario

[Here: visual comparison of Daily/Daily with Daily/Weekly, since this can only be done w/ sim data]

Section will discuss comparison of nowcasts with daily/daily data vs daily/weekly data. we could aggregate to weekly nowcasts to compare to weekly/weekly, or we could just save that for the real data because it didn't really seem that notable in the sim data. In the sim data I think what was notable was how well the daily/weekly model was doing compared to daily/daily.
